ABACUS-R currently consists of sequence design and mutation scanning two function, which could be used with following three steps:

(1) We recommend users make a directory to design a batch of sequence, with four parts e.g. batchtest.txt, inference_input/, inference_output/, PDBfile/

For batchtest.txt file, it tells the program design sequences based on which target. We recommend users write batchtest.txt in format like PDBNAME_CHAIN.
WARNING: "_" is forbidden to occur in PDBNAME to avoid confusion of CHAIN.

We recommend you store the PDB/mmCIF/mmCIF.gz file in the directory named PDBfile. If some specified sidechains are needed when designing the sequences, a file with
name like PDBNAME_CHAIN_spfile could be created in PDBfile, whose format could refer to ../final_model/sequence_design.yaml. If user need to design sequence based on a
given sequence, a fasta format file name-like PDBNAME_CHAIN_spseqs could be stored on PDBfile directory.
NOTE: We recommend PDB file with full mainchain atoms. Besides, line with alternative sidechain are also recommended to be removed in PDB file.

For inference_input directory, it plays the role of extract necessary information as input to model, which will be stored in inference_input directory.

The inference_output directory is used for storing the output information

(2) User could edit the content of ../final_model/sequence_design.yaml or ../final_model/multi_scan.yaml according to needs.
NOTE: Notation of parameters for designing sequence or mutation scanniing could refer to corresponding file (../final_model/sequence_design.yaml or ../final_model/multi_scan.yaml)

(3) After determining the parameters, user could run ../run.sh and check the output files in specified directory e.g. inference_output/


After designing process, two ouput file will be returned (PDBNAME_CHAIN_suffix_seq_design.jsonl, PDBNAME_CHAIN_suffix_all_inf.jsonl).

PDBNAME_CHAIN_suffix_seq_design.jsonl stores the information of designed sequences and its correpondding total logp, total entropy and total logits. Additionaly, logP and probabiility
for each site are also stored. Correspondidng information for native sequence and identity between designed sequences and native sequence are also calculated.

PDBNAME_CHAIN_suffix_all_inf.jsonl stores the information during designing process, including the evolution of sequence, identity between sequences in current step and sequence in the last step,
identity between sequences in current step and native sequences, the process of updated entropy, process of total logp, process of total logits and confusion sites (not self-consistent).

NOTE: Current version of ABACUS-R will not return a model with sidechain conformation, which could be achived by ABACUS2 or RosettaDesign for sidechain packing.
